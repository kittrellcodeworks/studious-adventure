# Robowar

An exploration of simple 2D game mechanics.

Based on an old mac game from the early 1990s. See http://robowar.sourceforge.net (Holy cow, my name is still listed on that website a couple of times!)

Many of the concepts in this project will be available from 3rd party, open-source libraries, but are being built from scratch, here, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how things work.
